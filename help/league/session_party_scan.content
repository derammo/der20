<div class='description'>This command records the player characters that are present in the session. This list is presented in <a href="#league/session_show">!league session show</a> to 
    select which player characters are included for APL calculation and awards.  If not all players were actually present when this command was last called, you can 
    call it again to redo the scan for players.</div>
