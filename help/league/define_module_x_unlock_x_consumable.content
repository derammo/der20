<div class='description'>If set to true, this unlock uses the consumables rules.  Specifically, the player character
    that picks up the consumable gets to keep it at the end of the session, while any picked up permanent magic items 
    disappear.  Setting this to true causes this unlock to be included in the session report as both an unlock and 
    a note specifying which character picked up the item, if specified via <a href='#league/session_module_x_unlock_x_owner'>!league session module current unlock [ID] owner</a>.
