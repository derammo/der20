<div class='description'>This command presents a dialog to interactively configure a Dungeon Master definition.
    The intent of this feature is to configure the name and DCI of a DM who uses the current game room, even there
    are multiple DMs sharing the room.  During a session, <a href="#rewards/dm">!rewards dm</a> can then be used
    to select the DM information to use in the rewards.
</div>
<div class='description'>Instead of using the interactive dialog, individual parameters of the DM definition 
    can be configured directly by simply appending the name
    of a value to set, as in <a href="#rewards/define_dm_x_name">!rewards define dm [ID] name [STRING]</a> and 
    <a href="#rewards/define_dm_x_dci">!rewards define dm [ID] dci [STRING]</a>
